\chapter{The Compiler}

The compiler turns \verb!.deja! source files in \verb!.vu! bytecode files. It
is allowed to take certain liberties in doing so. For instance, it may choose
to change calls to certain standard library functions into opcodes, if
applicable. Another way the compiler may differ is that it can provide built-in
macro definitions. In future versions of the language there may be stricter
rules about what the compiler can and cannot do.
