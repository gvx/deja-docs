\chapter{Foreword}

Déjà Vu is not a successful language, or a professional one. It is not
particularly ground-breaking or historically important. It is not
extreme in any interesting ways. And still, it is my opinion that it
can be an interesting to learn, if you're into that sort of thing. If
only to serve as a warning to others wanting to do what I have done.

This document is intended for people who like to learn useless things.
This is not something to read if you want to learn how to use Déjà Vu.
This is something to read if you want to learn about the plumbing and
clockwork that make Déjà Vu tick, or if you want to contribute to that
plumbing and clockwork somehow.

As I am writing this foreword, Déjà Vu is an ever-changing mess. A
poorly-documented one at that. I hope to use this document as something
that can guide me to make proper documentation, as well as
intellectually satisfy curious visitors to the language.

It is also an excuse to brag about my creations, obviously.
