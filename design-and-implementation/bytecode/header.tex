\section{The Header}

The header consists of 8 bytes, namely:

\begin{itemize}
\item 3 bytes for the magic cookie, in hexadecimal: 0x07 0x44 0x56. This is
      equivalent to the string \texttt{"\textbackslash{}aDV"} (with C-style
      escape codes).
\item 1 byte for the bytecode version. The first nybble is the major revision,
      the second nybble is the minor revision. Since the current bytecode
      version is 0.3, this byte should generally be 0x03.
\item 4 bytes for the length of the code, in instructions (each instruction is
      four bytes).
\end{itemize}
