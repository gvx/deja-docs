\chapter{Introduction}

Déjà Vu, the language as a whole, consists of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The source language.
\item The byte-code language.
\item The tool chain that futzes around with programs written in
      above-mentioned languages. (This includes the compiler).
\item The virtual machine that runs your programs.
\item The standard library at your disposal when writing programs.
      (This also includes the compiler. Don't worry, I'll explain
      later.)
\end{enumerate}

I hope to sufficiently explain all of these parts in the rest of this
document.

The design and implementation of \dv{} was strongly influenced by Python, and
to a lesser extent by Lua and Forth. For this reason, this document will often
compare \dv{} to these languages.
