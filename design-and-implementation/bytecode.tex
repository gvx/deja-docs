\chapter{The Bytecode Format}

The compiler generates bytecode, in a format which is described in this
chapter.

This bytecode is also used by the persistence mechanism.

Important to note is that all numbers are stored as big-endian encoded byte sequences. Word sizes used in Déjà Vu bytecode files are 8, 24, 32, and 64 bits.
