<h3>First things first</h3>
<p>This tutorial assumes you have prior programming experience. You'll need to
know about procedural programming, and some knowledge about functional
programming and stack-based programming will help. You probably will need to
run Linux, since that's what the Déjà Vu virtual machine was developed on, and
the creator of the language regretfully informs you that he hasn't got around
to adding support for alternative operating systems. Oh, and it probably will
crash hard if you try to run it on a 32-bit system. Good luck.
</p>
<h3>Installing Déjà Vu</h3>
<p>You can download the compiler and virtual machine straight from
<a href="https://github.com/gvx/deja">the repository</a>.</p>
<p>The compiler (along with assorted tools) is written in Python 2.6. If you
run Linux, you probably have that installed already (or a near enough version
of Python). If you have Python 3, it's probably possible to get that to work.
The compiler doesn't depend on anything but Python's standard library, so that
helps. (If you manage to do that, please send me a patch or a pull request or
what not.)
<p>You'll need to build the virtual machine with gcc. A Makefile is supplied in
the <code>vm/</code> directory that should be sufficient. Run <code>make
release</code> (a bare <code>make</code> will build both the release VM
(<code>vu</code>) and the VM used for debugging the language and virtual
machine itself (<code>vu-dbg</code>)).</p>
<p>You can test if everything works by running:</p>
<pre><code>touch null.deja
python dvc.py null.deja > null.vu
vm/vu null</code></pre>
<p>If nothing seems to happen, you're golden.</p>
<p>You'll notice an empty <code>null.deja</code> and a <code>null.vu</code> of
about 23 bytes are now in your working directory. We'll talk about
<code>.vu</code> files later. For now, remember this work flow (compiling with
<code>dvc.py</code> when you've made changes, running with <code>vu</code>).
(Side note: I probably should rewrite the compiler in C and integrate it with
the virtual machine, so that the compiling step is invisible, like in Python. I
promise I'll rewrite this section when I do that.)</p>
<h3>Our first program</h3>
<p>Déjà Vu will blow your mind. At least, I hope so. In this section, we will
go over a few example programs, with which I will try to slowly and gently blow
your mind.</p>
<pre><code>func sum list:
	local :total 0
	for item in list:
		set :total + total item
	return total

print sum [ 10 5 20 ]
</code></pre>
<p>You can probably guess what this program will print [...]</p>
